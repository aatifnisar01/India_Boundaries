# India_Boundaries

This repository contains administrative boundary shapefiles at multiple levels (village, panchayat, block) for 15 Indian states. 
The shapefiles are generated from authoritative sources (LGD, Census 2011, NASA SEDAC) and processed using Python tools to enable subdistrict, district, and state-level extraction and aggregation.
